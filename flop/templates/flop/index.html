        and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members
        contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who

      <p>Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python
         users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping
          in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good
          of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in
          person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.</p>

        their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
        We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python
        community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community,

      <p>Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not
        because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these
        guidelines will come naturally.</p>
